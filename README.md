## Motivation
This work is an extension of [our SIGIR 2020 paper](https://dgliu.github.io/files/SIGIR20_KDCRec.pdf). The new contents we have added include:

1. We have developed four new strategies to improve and supplement the original strategy.
2. We have included new experimental results and associated analyses, including the evaluation and analysis of new strategies, and the performance trends of the proposed framework on some key factors.
3. We have added more related work and discussions, as well as a formal problem definition.
4. We have made many improvements throughout the whole paper.
